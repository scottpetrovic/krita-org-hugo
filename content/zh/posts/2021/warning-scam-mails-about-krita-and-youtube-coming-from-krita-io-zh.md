如果您收到了并非来自 krita.org 域名发出的电子邮件 (电子邮件地址并未以 krita.org 结尾，例如 krita.io 或 krita.app 等)，请警惕它们其实是**诈骗电子邮件**。它们的内容可能类似于：

> Hello dear, please give me a moment of your time. Krita team is eager to collaborate with you.
> 
> Krita is a free and open-source raster graphics editor designed primarily for digital painting and 2D animation. It features an OpenGL-accelerated canvas, colour management support, an advanced brush engine, non-destructive layers and masks, group-based layer management, vector artwork support and switchable customisation profiles.
> 
> We would like to consider integrating a 30-45 second ready-made promo into your media space(Facebook, Instagram, YouTube), can we consider that?
> 
> Sincerely, Krita - Digital Painting Studio

**切勿回复这些邮件，并把它们标注为垃圾邮件。**
