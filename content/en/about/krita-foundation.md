# Krita Foundation

To support and further the development and use of Krita in any way imaginable, in 2012 the Krita community created the Krita Foundation. The Krita Foundation is be an independent non-profit, public organization with the following goals:

- To develop free graphics software, especially Krita
- To provide services for users and developers of Krita
- To provide artists and studios with everything they need to create digital art.

The Foundation tries to achieve this goal by funding development and initiating projects like the Comics with Krita DVD. For commercial support, we refer to [KO GmbH](http://www.kogmbh.com/krita), the company co-founded by the Krita maintainer.

If you want to help the Krita Foundation to reach its goals, you can donate or subscribe to the development fund. The funds will be used to sponsor Krita developers to work on Krita. Currently, the Krita Foundation supports Dmitry Kazakov to work on Krita for 2500 euros a month. Before that, the [KDE](http://www.kde.org) community has sponsored Lukáš Tvrdý. Sponsored development, Summer of Code and volunteer, enthousiast development are all essential to make Krita a great tool for artists everywhere!
