Phew! We're back up. It took quite a bit of effort, and we still need to migrate all the old content -- but we're up again! And in time for the 2.4 release, too.

It's bad enough to be hacked, it's bad enough to get flagged as an evil site, but the timing was so atrocious. But now we've got a nice new, up to date system all ready to bring you all the latest news about Krita.

See you tomorrow on Krita 2.4 release day!

In the meantime enjoy this little bit of playfulness with Krita's brush engine:
