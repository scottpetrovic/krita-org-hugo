The Krita team is proud to announce the release of Krita 2.4. Krita 2.4 is the second release of Krita that is ready for end users, and the first that is ready for professional digital artists. With many powerful brush engines and unique features as multi-hand and mirrored painting, Krita supports creating concept art, storyboards, textures, matte paintings and illustrations. Krita is already used by artists around the world.

Krita 2.4 adds new brush engines, many improvements to the existing brush engines and new productivity features like mirrored painting, plus important improvements in performance and compatibility with other applications. Ramon Miranda and Timothee Giet have assembled a brand new pack of patterns, gradients, brush tips and brush presets. Artists can exchange all these resources through the Get Hot New Stuff sharing server. Your strokes now can not just be influenced by tablet pressure, but by many more options, ranging from perspective guides to time and distance.
