Yesterday, the Muses DVD arrived from the printers. Today, all pre-orders got stuffed in jiffy bags and sent on to the post office! Irina Rempt did all the hard work of creating address labels, stuffing the bags, pasting on the stamps, and then we bagged the bags in Official Post Office bags! So, if you had ordered one, it's on its way!
