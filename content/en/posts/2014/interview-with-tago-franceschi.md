### How did you first find out about open source communities? What is your opinion about them?

In 2005, a friend told me about Ubuntu, and since then I discover it. I love the open source philosophy, I think it's a great project and all those who participate are awesome people!

### What was your first take on Krita when you tried it?

My first impression of krita has been very positive, intuitive interface and an excellent management of shortcuts and I don't know, for me, after using photoshop elements and gimp for several years, it was love at first sight!

### What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Also, anything that you really hate about Krita?

For the improvements don't know, the only thing that makes me mad is the management of adjustments made with curves, I would prefer the bars with more or less ... I hope you understand what I mean.

### In your opinion, what sets Krita apart from the other tools that you may be using?

In the past two years I have used only krita, I think it's for the responsiveness of the brush, with the tools that I used previously didn't have the same feeling.

### If you had to pick one favorite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be?

Good question! Perhaps "bellezza sul lago".

### What is it that you like about it? What brushes did you use in it?

In it I was able to retain, I think with a good result, different styles (impressionism and realism) in a single work. I used the default brush, with variation in size, opacity and shape (round and square).

### Would you like to share it with our site visitors?

Sure, no problem!
