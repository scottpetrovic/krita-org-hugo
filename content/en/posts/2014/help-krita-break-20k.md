Thank you everyone for [your amazing support](http://kck.st/1iiMs9O)! We're so close to breaking through 20K, and with your help we can and will do it! To say thank-you, once we break through 20k, we'll be giving each and every backer, large or small, one final extra reward: A once-only, personalized "Kickstarter 20K Edition" Kiki wallpaper!  
  
The text, the language, your name -- it will all be customized for you! Here's a rough mockup (expect the final to be more polished):
