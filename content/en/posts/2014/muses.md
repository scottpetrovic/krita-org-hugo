"Muses" is the second Krita training DVD released by the Krita Foundation. The Muses DVD was created by [Ramon Miranda](http://www.ramonmiranda.com/). the Spanish artist responsible for, among other things, the Paint Studio project.

The Muses DVD contains about five hours of detail-packed instruction, covering the whole process from setting up Krita to printing a finished work of art. The DVD isn't just about using Krita's interface, though, it's a complete creative course. The DVD is spanish-spoken with English and Spanish subtitles.
