### Could you tell us something about yourself?

I have a HUGE problem in picking favorites, copy others' styles when I'm lazy (hehe):-D, ABSOLUTELY LOVE TO DRAW, play Minecraft, BlockstarPlanet, extra extra, horrible at controller, all my friends have a TV or TVs and I dont :(, hate Roblox but can still play it in Roblox banned countries and I basically love dark and creepy AND I'm not girly or boyish.

Birthday on November 30th so now I'm 12.

I have a lot of books (I love reading).

I also hate putting the signature after I draw cause it seems annoying inÂ  my bad handwriting.
