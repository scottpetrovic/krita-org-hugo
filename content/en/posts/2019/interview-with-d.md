### Could you tell us something about yourself?

I live in Russia, Sochi. Graduated from art school and University with a degree in design. I've drawn since early childhood. I remember that it was my favorite pastime.

### Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?

I professionally create logos, and covers for music albums to order. Digital painting on my topics I do not for commerce, but for the soul. Rather, I consider it my real calling, the opportunity to tell something to the world. In this respect I was very inspired by the experience of the French artist David Revoy.

### What genre(s) do you work in?

I work in different genres, but I am most attracted to sci-fi and fantasy. Mainly in a realistic presentation.

### Whose work inspires you most -- who are your role models as an artist?

As artists in digital art [Theo Prins](http://www.theoprins.com/), [Jakub Rebelka](http://shzrebelka.tumblr.com/) and [Simon St√•lenhag](https://simonstalenhag.se/) inspire me.

### How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?

I first tried digital painting at school, 17 years ago. I really liked one of the covers of the game Heroes of Might and Magic III. I was was only for drawing). I did not have a graphics tablet, I drew with the mouse, but tried very hard.

### What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?

I am equally respectful of traditional and digital painting. Although earlier I underestimated digital painting, considering that traditional is more "real" and alive. Now I've changed my mind. They simply cannot be compared. But technically I am more comfortable with digital painting, it opens up more opportunities in manipulations with the finished image, it allows you to fully draw in a variety of conditions and places. And most importantly, it allows you to better convey it to the viewer, with help of the network and open licenses.

### How did you find out about Krita?

By accident! I have not been engaged in digital painting for a long time and a few months ago I decided to return to it. At the same time, I became interested in free software. I started searching the Internet and Krita was one of the first things I found. Decided to try out of curiosity and did not regret it.

### What was your first impression?

I was absolutely ecstatic! Krita brought back my desire to draw in digital painting! First, I bribed the screen saver with a picture of an anime character. Then I started to understand the interface and realized that it was absolutely familiar and understandable to me. Soon I felt that this program was made by artists for artists (I think so).

### What do you love about Krita?

Interface. It's very comfortable to navigate the program. I like the basic sets of brushes. Also a great opportunity to edit the picture in color and tone. It is also possible to make animation.

### What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?

I do not have more extended features of transformation of the elements of the layers. This is not always necessary, so it's a small problem.

### What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?

Simplicity combined with great features. And versatility.

### If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?

![](images/city-of-illusions-800.jpg)

This is my first work in Krita, "City of Illusions". Simply because it is the first. Also because I had an idea and a sketch for this work for a long time, but I couldn't find the tools and programs to implement them. I think it turned out well in Krita.

### What techniques and brushes did you use in it?

I tried many different techniques and brushes, because in this work I mastered the possibilities of the program. Most often I used Chalks, Pencils, Dry Bristles, Dry Brushes and Adjust Color.

### Where can people see more of your work?

Some of my work can be seen on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sivakov_d/) and [Behance](https://www.behance.net/dolmensoch278b).

### Anything else you'd like to share?

I plan to open a studio, where I will teach people to work in digital painting with Krita, as well as jointly create art projects with my students and like-minded people, to help promote this program.
