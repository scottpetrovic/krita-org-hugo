Today we're releasing Krita 4.2.0. This is a big release, with over a thousand bugs fixed and exciting new functionality like support for HDR displays.

Compared to the last [beta,](/item/krita-4-2-0-beta-released/) there have been over 30 bug fixes. New in Krita 4.2.0 is updated support for drawing tablets, support for HDR monitors on Windows, an improved color palette docker, scripting API for animation, color gamut masking, improved selection handling, much nicer handling of the interaction between opacity and flow and much, much, much more.

Dive into [the release notes](/krita-4-2-release-notes/) for a full overview!

And there's also the lovely new splash image by Tyson Tan!
