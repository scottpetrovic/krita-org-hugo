Freshly returned from the 2019 Blender Conference, Krita project maintainer Boudewijn Rempt was heard to wistfully wish for something like Blender Artists, only for Krita. A central place for artists who use Krita to discuss their work, ask for help, share experiences and reach out to developers. And in the interest of growing the community, not something that needs to be maintained and developed by the current development team, the Krita Foundation or the KDE community.

Raghavendra Kamath, a professional illustrator who has used Krita for years and years accepted the challenge and has setup over the past week a new website: [krita-artists.org](https://krita-artists.org). It's brand new and still slightly experimental, but we're announcing it today!

Go out and have fun!
