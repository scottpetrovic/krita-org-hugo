Krita needs you! We've new test builds of what will become Krita 4.2. There are two changes that we really would like everyone to test!

**DO NOT USE THIS FOR REAL WORK. ONLY FOR TESTING.**

**YOU MIGHT LOSE YOUR WORK!**

First, following [two discussions](https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=288&t=136165) on [the forum](https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=139&t=152017), William Brown created his [very first patch for Krita](https://phabricator.kde.org/D18467). This changes the way flow and opacitiy interact:

Now these changes really touch the core of what Krita does, that is painting, so we'd like all of you to go out, download a test build and play with it.

The second change is even scarier... We swapped out the engine that encodes and decodes Krita files.

Krita's .kra format is actually a simple zip file. And simple zip files have a limit: they cannot be bigger than 4GiB.Â  And it turns out that people working with animations sometimes do make files bigger than that...

So we are now using a new library, [quazip](https://stachenov.github.io/quazip/), that supports the Zip64 standard. But we use that library now wherever we load and save .kra files, but also [OpenRaster](https://www.openraster.org/) files, resource bundles -- everything that's a zip file. By default, Zip64 is disabled: if you're working on big animations, you need to manually enable Zip64 functionality:
