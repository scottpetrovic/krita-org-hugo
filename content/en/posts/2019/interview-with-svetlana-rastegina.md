### Could you tell us something about yourself?

My name is Svetlana Rastegina. I work in graphic design and 3D modeling. I have been painting since I was twelve. I have a background in watercolour painting.

### Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?

I'm a professional graphic artist. Although, sometimes I get carried away drawing for myself.

### What genre(s) do you work in?

I work in various genres: fantasy, cartoons, conceptual, children's illustration. Among these genres, my favorite is fantasy.

### Whose work inspires you most -- who are your role models as an artist?

I donâ€™t have a single favorite artist. The creativity of many artists appeals to me and I try to learn the best from each of them. Among Russian illustrators I like [Vladyslav Yerko](http://www.muddycolors.com/2012/12/masters-of-contemporary-illustration-vladyslav-yerko/).

### How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?

For the first time I tried digital painting at the university, where I studied environment design. I started drawing on the tablet in 2006.

### What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?

I think prefer working with digital painting because it is more dynamic and provides more freedom.

### How did you find out about Krita?

I prefer software with an open source license. One of my friends suggested to try it and it met my needs.

### What was your first impression?

It was very easy to start working in Krita. I fell in love with it almost immediately.

### What do you love about Krita?

I like the big set of brushes and filters. And above all I like stability.

### What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?

I would like a bigger dynamic menu to have more brushes on hand.

### What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?

Krita has one of the most convenient interface and tool sets for working with illustrations.

### If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?

It is very difficult to choose only one project. From my recent works I would pick the Cellist, because I like to work in the fantasy genre and monochrome colors.

### What techniques and brushes did you use in it?

I work in the technique of a smoothed dab with the subsequent parts refinement, often using texture technique. I make multiple layers, with separate layer for sketching, shadows, highlights and some details. Some brushes used in the work: Basic, Blender blur, Dry Bristles, Chalc Grainy, Blender Textured Soft.
