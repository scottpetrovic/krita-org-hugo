The [2010 Libre Graphics meeting](http://libregraphicsmeeting.org) is next month. From the Krita team, at least Boudewijn and Lukas will attend. It's not just the most fun gathering of people developing _and_ using free graphics software, but it's always a great catalyst for participating projects. For instance, working together on OpenRaster to make it easy to work on the same image in Krita, MyPaint and the Gimp happens here. Read Alexandre Prokoudine's article "[Libre Graphics Meeting, why it matters"](http://www.libregraphicsworld.org/articles.php?article_id=15) and Nathan Willis' [writeup](http://create.freedesktop.org/wiki/Press_Release_2010_Community) -- and consider helping the organization with a small [donation](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/8926)!
