Approximately 1600 commits by more than a dozen authors make up the difference between Krita 2.1 and Krita 2.2. Hundreds of bugs, too many to enumerate were fixed. While Krita 2.2 still isn't the no-excuses release that everyone should be able to use for real work, it's a very solid piece of work with many interesting new features and important improvements.

Krita 2.2 includes the first third of Lukas' sponsored work on Krita: trunk froze for the release while he was in the middle of a lot of other improvements. Those will be in 2.3!
