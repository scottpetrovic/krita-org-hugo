Since Krita is a KDE application, KDE e.V. sponsors activities like travel to the [Libre Graphics Meeting](http://www.libregraphicsmeeting.org). So, if you donate, what will your money be used for? The community around Krita has in the past donated money to buy hardware -- Wacom tablets -- and to enable [Lukas to work full-time](http://krita.org/index.php&option=com_content&id=20) for several months. Future plans which will need money are having the Krita manual professionally edited (of course, we need to write it first!) and buying a Wacom airbrush device so we can work on supporting the special features of that too. And we will be looking for more opportunities for sponsored development work of course!
