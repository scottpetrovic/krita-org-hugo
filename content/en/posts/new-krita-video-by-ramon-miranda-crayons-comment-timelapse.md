We've got a new video for you! Ramon Miranda uses the set of crayons brush brush presets to make a drawing, and tells you what he's doing along the way. The brush presets can be downloaded from https://files.kde.org/krita/extras/back\_to\_school/ -- and there's a template file as well, to get started with!
