**AND THEY ARE BACK... This time with krita.studio**

**ANOTHER UPDATE: there are now also fake installers that you are asked to run. Only download krita from this website, Steam, Windows Store or Epic Store!**

**UPDATE: THIS IS A RANSOMWARE ATTACK. If you reply, you will get a link to a mediabank.zip file that contains two programs masquerading as videos. These are very probably ransomware programs that will encrypt your drive and ask you for a ransom.**

If you receive mail pretending to come from the Krita team from an email address that does not end in krita.org, like krita.io or krita.app, please be aware that these mails are **scams**. The mail will be like

> Hello dear, please give me a moment of your time. Krita team is eager to collaborate with you.
> 
> Krita is a free and open-source raster graphics editor designed primarily for digital painting and 2D animation. It features an OpenGL-accelerated canvas, colour management support, an advanced brush engine, non-destructive layers and masks, group-based layer management, vector artwork support and switchable customisation profiles.
> 
> We would like to consider integrating a 30-45 second ready-made promo into your media space(Facebook, Instagram, YouTube), can we consider that?
> 
> Sincerely, Krita - Digital Painting Studio

**Do not reply, just junk the mail.**
