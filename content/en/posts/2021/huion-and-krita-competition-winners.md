We have the winners! We had them yesterday already, but in the excitement of getting her first covid vaccine shot, Halla forgot to make the announcement. Sorry! The jury, consisting of Ramon Miranda, Agata Cacko and Wolthera van Hövell tot Westerflier had a hard time making their choices: the quality of the submissions was just amazing!

In the first place, winning the Kamvas 22 is "[Watch out Leon!](https://krita-artists.org/t/watch-out-leon/21706)" by Greasy Microphone!
