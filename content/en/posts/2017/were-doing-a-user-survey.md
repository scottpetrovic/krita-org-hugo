While we're still working on Vector, Text and Python Scripting, we've already decided: This year, we want to spend on stabilizing and polishing Krita!

Now, one of the important elements in making Krita stable is bug reports. And we've got a lot of those! But with some bug reports, we're kind of stuck. We cannot figure out what type of hardware or drivers it is that is causing these bugs, so we're asking for you help.

[We've made a Krita user survey.](https://goo.gl/forms/9SUIE7xwszu2T7RB3)

In it, we ask things like what type of hardware you have, and whether you have trouble with certain hardware. That way we can figure out which drivers and hardware are problematic and maybe get workarounds. There's also some other questions, like what you make with Krita and how you get your Krita news.
