title: "Google Summer of Code: Help Alexey Kapustin by Testing His Work!"

The Google Summer of Code is nearly at an end. One of our students, Alexey Kapustin, has made a Windows build of [his work](https://community.kde.org/GSoC/2017/StatusReports/AlexeyKapustin). Alexey has created a version of Krita that helps us figure out how people actually use Krita by aggregating anonymous data on how often Krita is started, how long it's used, which tools are used, which options and filters are most popular and so on.

Of course, this is still an experimental version: if it becomes part of the regular release it will be **opt-in**, not opt-out.Â  Within the KDE community we have created a policy for this kind of thing: [https://community.kde.org/Policies/Telemetry_Policy](https://community.kde.org/Policies/Telemetry_Policy) .

If you want to help Alexey and are a Windows user, please download his special version of Krita 4.0 pre-alpha and play with it. There's still a lot of work to do, of course, but first we need testers!
