Today we are releasing Krita 3.3.1, a bugfix release for Krita 3.3.0. This release fixes two important regressions:

- Krita would crash if you would restart Krita after closing Krita with the reference images docker set to floating
- Krita 3.3.0 could not read .kra backup files or .kra files that were unzipped, then zipped up manually.

Additionally, there are the following fixes and improvements:

- Fix a crash when creating a swap file on OSX (Bernhard Liebl).
- Merge down does not remove locked layers anymore (Nikita Smirnov)
- Various performance improvements, especially for macOS (Bernhard Liebl)
- Improve the look and feel of dragging and dropping layers (Bernhard Liebl)
- Improve the tooltips in the brush preset selector (Bernhard Liebl)
- Fix a memory leak in the color selectors (Boudewijn Rempt)
- Fix rotation and tilt when using the Windows Ink api (Alvin Wong)
- Don't allow the fill tool to be used on group layers (Boudewijn Rempt)
- Add brightness and contrast sliders for textured brushes (Rad)
- Add paste-at-cursor (Dmitry Kazakov)
- Improve performance of the cpu canvas (Alvin Wong)
- Fix a crash on closing Krita when there is something on the clipboard (Dmitry Kazakov)
- Add a button to open a file layer's image in Krita (Wolthera van HÃ¶vell tot Westerflier)
