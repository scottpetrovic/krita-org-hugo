**Made With Krita 2016** is now available! This morning the printer delivered 250 copies of the first book filled with art created in Krita by great artists from all around the world. We immediately set to work to send out all pre-orders, including the ones that were a kickstarter reward.

The books themselves are gorgeous. The artwork is great and varied, of course, but the printer did a good job on the colors, too -- helped by the excellent way the open source desktop publishing application [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net) prepares PDF's for printing. The picture doesn't do it justice, since it was made with an old phone...
