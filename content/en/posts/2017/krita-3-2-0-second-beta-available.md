title: "Krita 3.2.0: Second Beta Available"
date: "2017-07-22"
---

We're releasing the second beta for Krita 3.2.0 today! These beta builds contain the following fixes, compared to [the first 3.2.0 beta release](https://krita.org/en/item/krita-3-2-beta-1-released/). Keep in mind that this is a beta: you're supposed to help the development team out by testing it, and reporting issues on [bugs.kde.org](https://bugs.kde.org).

- There are still problems on Windows with the integration with the gmic-qt plugin, but several lockups have been fixed.
- The smart patch tool merge was botched: this is fixed now.
- It wasn't possible anymore to move vector objects with the mouse (finger and tablet worked fine). This is fixed now.
- Fixed the size and flow sliders
- Fixes to saving jpg or png images without a transparency channel
