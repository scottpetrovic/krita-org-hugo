The Kickstarter has been funded so we'll be needing T-shirts! Here's your chance to earn fame by designing the one we'll send to our backers: [Special June drawing challenge](https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=277&t=133220&p=357788)!

The topic is: **FLOW** \-- interpret it any way you like. If your design wins the poll, it will be printed on all the Kickstarter backer shirts and we'll send you one, too.

The contest is open until June 24, 12:00 UTC. That's almost three weeks!
