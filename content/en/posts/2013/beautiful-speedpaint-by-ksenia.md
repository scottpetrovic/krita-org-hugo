**When and how did you end up trying digital painting for the first time?  
**Several years ago I tried to draw manga digitally. But I started using computer as a painting medium less than a year ago.

**How did you find out about Krita?  
**Though Ramon Miranda's and Deevad's blogs.

**What was your first take on it?  
**At first I didn't like it, because it was slow, But later I bought a better computer, Krita itself has improved and now I find it very pleasant to use it.

**What do you love about Krita?  
**I love its awesome powers, all filters, brush engine, vector layers. I also like the shortcuts that help you work really fast. And I like the auto-safe feature so that I never lose my work even if I forget to safe.

**What do you think needs improvement in Krita?  
**First of all it needs more people to know about it and to use it, because Krita is really awesome!

Thanks to Ksenya, enjoy it!
