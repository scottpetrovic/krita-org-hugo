Krita is a trademark owned by the Stichting Krita Foundation. This page outlines the policy and guidelines of the Stichting Krita Foundation for the trademark and the logo we use to identify Krita.

The following information helps ensure our mark and logo are used in approved ways, while making it easy for the community to understand the guidelines. If you have any questions about the use of logos or trademarks that are not addressed in these guidelines, feel free to [contact us](mailto:foundation@krita.org).

The purpose of this policy is to protect the public, by ensuring that the identity, provenance, and open-source nature of Krita remain clear. Throughout this document, the "Marks" refers to the Krita name and logo, individually or together.

#### Guidelines for Using the Marks

1. You may use the Krita Mark without prior written permission for the following purposes (subject to the other sections):
    
    1. To refer to the Krita software in substantially unmodified form ("substantially unmodified" means built from the source code provided by the Krita project, possibly with minor modifications including but not limited to: the enabling or disabling of certain features by default, changes required for compatibility with a particular operating system distribution, or the inclusion of bugfix patches);
        
    2. To identify Krita as a distinct component of a software offering;
        
    3. To refer to the Krita project itself, its products, or its protocols.
        
2. You may use "Krita" as part of the name of a product designed to work with Krita, so long as the name as a whole (via its other components) clearly and unambiguously distinguishes the product from Krita itself, and the general presentation of the product does not imply any official association or identity with Krita. Because it would be awkward to attach a trademark symbol to a portion of a larger name whose other portions might themselves be trademarked, the requirement to display the symbol is waived for this circumstance.
    
3. You may not use the Marks in the following ways (without prior permission):
    
    1. In any way likely to cause confusion as to the identity of the  project, the provenance of its software, or the software's license;
        
    2. In any way that indicates a greater degree of association between you and the Krita project than actually exists;
        
    3. In any way that implies a designated successor to Krita (e.g., "Krita NG" would be bad).
        
4. The Stichting Krita Foundation reserves the sole right to:
    
    1. Determine compliance with this policy;
        
    2. Modify this policy in ways consistent with its mission of protecting the public;
        
    3. Grant exceptions to this policy, of any kind and for any reason whatsoever, other clauses notwithstanding.
        

If you have questions about using the Marks, or if you think you should be able to use the Marks for any purpose not allowed by this policy and would like permission for that use, please contact the [Stichting Krita Foundation](http://krita.org/foundation) by emailing **foundation@krita.org**.
