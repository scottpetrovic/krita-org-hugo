Following hot on the heels of the wraparound tool comes yet another very cool feature! This time, the tool that we are presenting is especially useful for game designers.The **Clones Array function** will help the creators of games where the world consists of a set of small tiles of different kinds.

This is a new feature developed by dmitryK and it will be available in Krita 2.8!

Watch the video to see how it will work:
