Tyson Tan, the father of our mascot, has collaborated with us for our [merchandise shop](http://www.zazzle.com/kritashop)!

Some time ago he drew our [mascot](https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mascot_20120519_krita3ss.png) for fun and it became the Krita official mascot! Now he has for us this awesome design of "Kiki the Cyber Squirrel" and also... an artistic [Konqui](https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=254&t=109758)! So much thanks to Tyson forÂ  this wonderful work and these great designs, it's impossible to have a cuter mascot than this!
