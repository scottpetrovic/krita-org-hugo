We got in touch with Ramon Miranda, the artist who is working on the Krita "Muses" training DVD. He is making lots of progress now! Here is what he told us:

"Making a DVD involves a lot of work, I'm learning a lot in this process and I hope that you will like all the final result. The project is going forward  and I'm all the time finding new ways to make awesome art with Krita!"

"You all know that I'm a bit "freak" of the "fine arts" style, so I try to emulate it in digital painting. So I thought, let's change this classical way and create new things!"

"I'm still developing and improving the DVD but I want to show you some tests and stuff! Did you already pre-ordered your copy? Lets give support and love to Krita! :)"
