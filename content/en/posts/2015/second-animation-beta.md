title: "Second Animation Beta"
date: "2015-12-12"
---

With lots of bug fixes. This is still based on the stable 2.9 version of Krita, though, not on what will become Krita 3.0. But there are a lot of crash fixes, bug fixes and improvements, and the following operations now work on animations as well:

- Merge Down
- Merge multiple layers
- Flatten Layer
- Flatten Image
- Convert Image/Layer Color Space
- Crop Image/Layer
- Scale Image/Layer
- Rotate Image/Layer
- Shear Image/Layer

Nathan Lovato has made a nice introduction video:

(And don't forget to support his [kickstarter!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/game-art-quest-make-professional-2d-art-with-krita), now close to reaching the first stretch goal.)

For Ubuntu Linux, you can get the second animation beta through the Krita Lime repositories. Just choose 'krita-animation-testing' package:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dimula73/krita
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install krita-animation-testing 

#### Packages for Windows:

For Windows, two packages are available: 64-bit, 32-bit:

- [64 bits Windows zip file](http://files.kde.org/krita/windows/krita_2.9.10.1ae_beta_x64.zip)
- [32 bits Windows zip file](http://files.kde.org/krita/windows/krita_2.9.10.1ae_beta_x86.zip)

You can download the zip files and just unpack them, for instance on your desktop and run. You might get a warning that the Visual Studio 2012 Runtime DLL is missing: you can download the missing dll [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679). You do not need to uninstall any other version of Krita before giving these packages a try!
