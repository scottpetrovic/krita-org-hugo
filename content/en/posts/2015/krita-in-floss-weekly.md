Yesterday, Randal Schwartz andÂ Aaron Newcomb interviewed Krita maintainer Boudewijn Rempt about [Krita for their weekly podcast FLOSS Weekly](http://twit.tv/show/floss-weekly/324). The live webcast was an enjoyable, if intense experience -- and now the episode is available for download! Also, art was created right there, on the show!
