We ended with €30,520 on kickstarter and €3108 through paypal -- making for a grand total of €33,628, and that means LOD, Animation and nine stretch goal. We're so happy. It's really an amazing result. So, thanks and hugs to all our supporters! And we promise to make Krita better and better -- and better!

We're already working on the surveys, and if you backed through paypal and didn't get a survey by next week, please mail us. For paypal, we have to do a bit of manual work!That's all for now, we're a bit tired after the most intense 30 days of the year :-)
