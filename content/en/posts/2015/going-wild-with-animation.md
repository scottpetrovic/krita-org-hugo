We knew the animation plugin was something artists all over the world were really waiting for... What we hadn't expected was the flood of cool little animations that suddenly appeared everywhere! Let's take a look at a selection of them! And in another way, the release also helped find some issues. First: if onion skinning doesn't work for you, check that you're not trying to onion skin a completely opaque layer. Yes -- white is also opaque! The best setup: create a white background layer, but paint on a transparent layer above that. That's Krita's default setup in any case. For some people with some combinations of graphics cards and drivers, the Instant Preview doesn't work. There's not much we can do about that, but we do need your reports! And finally, a couple of real bugs surfaced, and we'll look at that next.

But here's the animation gallery!
