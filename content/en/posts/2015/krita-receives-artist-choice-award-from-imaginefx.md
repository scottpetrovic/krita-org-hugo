That's appreciation with a vengeance!  ImagineFX is the #1 resource for concept artists and illustrators in the entertainment industry. It is a great resource if you are looking to level up your art skills.

You can pick up the January 2015 issue at newsstands or on the [website](http://www.zinio.com/www/browse/issue.jsp?skuId=416324355). The USA distribution takes a bit longer to arrive, so you might have to wait a bit before you see it in places like Barnes & Noble.
