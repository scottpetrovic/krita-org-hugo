Only one week after we sent out our Kickstarter survey, 581 of the 661 15-euro-and-up backers (including the PayPal backers) have sent in their votes. This is a response rate of a whopping 87.90%! Here's the current tally:

| 1 | 113 | 19.45% | 10\. Animated file formats export: animated gif, animated png and spritemaps |
