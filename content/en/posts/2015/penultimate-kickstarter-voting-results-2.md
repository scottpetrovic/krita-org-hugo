Two weeks before voting closes we're at a response rate of 91.38%: 604 of 661 possible votes. If you're eligible to vote and haven't done so yet, you have until 10am CEST on July 6 to make the response rate even higher! Note that no-award backers who have pledged 15 euros or more can _also_ vote, though they haven't received a survey. If this is you, please send mail to [irina@krita.org](mailto:"irina@krita.org"), either with your vote or to ask for the list.

We collected enough pledges for nine whole stretch goals. Two 1500-euro backers each added a stretch goal of their own: one already in the list ("Update the look & feel of the layer docker" which is at #6, meaning that #10, "Stacked brushes" got in as well) and one off-list, "Lazy Brush" -- [you can see how it works here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTUefe5HGKU "Lazy brush video").

The table below shows the penultimate results, with in the last column the related phabricator task. To access phabricator you will need a KDE identity account, which can be made at [identity.kde.org](https://identity.kde.org/). If you have a forum account, you already have made a KDE identity account. Use this login information in the 'LDAP' login area. The phabricator tasks are where we discuss the requirements of each feature. This means that all considerations about the implementation are mentioned here. You can subscribe to a phabricator task to get e-mail updates on it.
