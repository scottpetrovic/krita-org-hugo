We're still only in beta phase, but LWN's Nathan Willis has published an overview of where we're going with Krita 2.4: "[A quick sketch of Krita 2.4](http://lwn.net/Articles/464495/)". It's a pretty good read! Also, check out David Revoy's overview of Krita 2.4: "[KRITA 2.4 beta : screenshots , features and PPA"](http://www.davidrevoy.com/index.php?article98/krita-2-4-beta-screenshots-features-and-ppa "KRITA 2.4 beta : screenshots , features and PPA").

Soon, we hope to have a real release candidate. There are still plenty of bugs to be fixed, more than one hundred that we know of. But please help us with finding the bugs we don't know of yet on Saturday, during the krita bug day on #krita on freenode!
