title: "Krita Artist Session Recording Part II: Animtim's turn"
date: "2011-06-07"
---

Krita's training DVD producing hero, Animtim, shows in this video how he uses Krita to create a full character. He did this before, at LGM 2011, but the recording of his presentation there isn't up yet. Note how he handles layers by creating a group for them, the sketching with the sketch brush, inking with the sketch brush and creating a coloring layer. This sessions showed us that the sketch brush is way cool and that we have some work to do with the fill tools! Also, Animtim exposed a bug in the layer box that is now fixed, and some more inconveniences that Pentalis is working on. Pentalis and Silvio Heinrich (tomorrow's demoing artist!) committed their improvements to the preset editor yesterday.

We're doing well with the fundraiser for the [training dvd project](http://krita.org/component/content/article/10-news/81-become-part-of-kritas-first-training-dvd) -- but we haven't reached the goal yet (note the cool progressbar our webmaster and [yesterday's showcasing artist](http://krita.org/component/content/article/10-news/84-krita-artist-session-recording-part-i-painting-bugs) Bugsbane added to the website) :

And the very cool [Project NEON](https://launchpad.net/%7Eneon) now has daily builds of Calligra for Ubuntu and friends: a few simple commands should be enough to get you the latest Krita to play with:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neon/ppa   
&& sudo apt-get update  
&& sudo apt-get install project-neon-base   
Â   project-neon-calligra   
   project-neon-calligra-dbg  

If you paste that in a terminal, you should have a completely safe install of Calligra in /opt, ready to play with!
