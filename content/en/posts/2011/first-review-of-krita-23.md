Nathan Willis has published the first review of Krita 2.3: [Modern Art: A Look at Krita 2.3](http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/425446-modern-art-a-look-at-krita-23) . Well worth a read! Soon the first snapshot release of Calligra will be out, which will contain a Krita with heaps of new features, but as Nathan says: Krita 2.3 (now at revision 2.3.3) is well worth giving a try! Your distribution most likely packages it already.
