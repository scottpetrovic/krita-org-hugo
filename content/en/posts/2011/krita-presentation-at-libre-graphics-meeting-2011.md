Last week Lukas and Animtim gave a joint presentation on Krita at the [2011 Libre Graphics Meeting](http://libregraphicsmeeting.org) in Montreal. It was a great success! One of the people in the audience was [Linux Weekly News](http://lwn.net) Nathan Willis, who the same week published [his take on the presentation](http://lwn.net/Articles/442400). It's now freely readable, and well worth reading!
