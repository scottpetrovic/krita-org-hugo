Yes! We're getting somewhere! We're going places! Krita is a finalist in the 2011 [Packt Open Source Awards](http://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home?utm_source=updated_banner&utm_medium=homepage_banner&utm_campaign=unique_banner). Of course, there's some very strong competition, for instance Blender has made huge progress in the past year.

But hey, so did we! Krita 2.3 was the first no-quibbles, user-ready release, and that's already ancient compared to the 2.4 beta's we're releasing right now. And Krita has some pretty unique features, like the OpenGL canvas, the wide range of colormodels and channel depths we support and the outstanding variety of brush engines... And much, much more.  

[So, plenty of reasons to vote for Krita!](https://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home/vote-open-source-multimedia-software)
