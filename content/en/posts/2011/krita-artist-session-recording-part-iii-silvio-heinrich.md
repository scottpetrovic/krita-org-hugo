title: "Krita Artist Session Recording Part III: Silvio Heinrich"

Today artists and Krita developer Silvio Heinrich shows how he works his [paintings](http://abnormalwit.deviantart.com/). Again completely different from Animtim and Bugsbane's way of working, he starts with an underpainting which he then colors in another layer. Silvio's style of working is far more painterly than anything we've seen before.  

Check out his other cool work at [DeviantArt](http://abnormalwit.deviantart.com/)!

We're now at â‚¬291,41 or 15% -- after Paypal's cut -- for [Animtim's Training DVD project](http://krita.org/component/content/article/10-news/81-become-part-of-kritas-first-training-dvd)!
