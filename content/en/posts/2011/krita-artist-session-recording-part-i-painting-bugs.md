title: "Krita Artist Session Recording Part I: Painting Bugs"
date: "2011-06-06"

Over the coming days, I'll post the recordings of the [sessions](http://krita.org/component/content/article/10-news/77-second-day-of-the-third-krita-sprint) we had with Krita artists Bugsbane, Animtim, Silvio Heinrich and David Revoy during the Krita sprint in Amsterdam.Â  Each artists had about half an hour to show the developers and artists their way of working with Krita. And they had the freedom to complain about everything!

I'm splitting up the posts because the total viewing time is well over two hours. And also because of our ongoing DVD fundraiser, of course!  

This is the first session. On the one hand, it's an instructional recording showing how to work with Krita in one particular way -- starting with the particle brush to create shapes, working with layers in different ways to build up the image. On the other hand, for us developers it was immensely valuable to see all the little roadblocks... Some of which have been fixed in the meantime!

So enjoy Bugsbane painting bugs!

And don't forget our DVD [fundraiser](http://krita.org/component/content/article/10-news/81-become-part-of-kritas-first-training-dvd). Help Animtim create some great training material for artists everywhere!
