We have finally figured out how to update Krita on Steam to the latest version. We're really sorry for the long delays, but we plan to keep Krita up to date from now.

That means that Krita Gemini has been replaced by the regular desktop Krita: no matter where you get Krita, Steam, the Windows Store or krita.org, you get the same experience. Getting Krita on Steam helps support Krita's full-time development, and from now on gets you updates whenever we create a new version.

We also have some new plans, like supporting macOS and Linux through Steam.
