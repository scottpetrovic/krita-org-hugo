Over the past months, Ramon Miranda, known for [his wonderful introduction to digital painting, Muses](https://gum.co/SZZDI?wanted=true), has worked on creating a complete new brush preset bundle: Digital Atelier. Not only does this contain over **fifty** new brush presets, more than **thirty** new brush tips and **twenty** patterns and surfaces.

There is almost **two** **hours** of in-depth video tutorial, working you through the process of creating new brush presets.

Ramon has gone deep here! The goal was to create painterly brushes: achieving the look and feel of oil paint, pastel or water colors. Ramon did a lot of research and experimentation and it has paid off handsomely:
