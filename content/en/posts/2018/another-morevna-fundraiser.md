Nikolai and his team are running [a crowdfunding campaign](https://morevnaproject.org/crowdfunding/morevna-episode-4/) to make this happen. Among the rewards:

And many other exclusive rewards! By claiming any of them, you are helping Nikolai and the team of Morevna to bring one more animation project powered by open-source technologies. The success of this project depends on your support!

The series is a futuristic adaptation of the traditional Russian fairy tale "Marya Morevna" (also known as "The Death of Koschei the Deathless"). The action takes place in the distant future, where horses are replaced by bikes and cars, the main protagonist Ivan Tsarevich turns into a talented mechanic, Marya Morevna is a biker queen with a samurai sword, and Koschei is more immortal and evil than ever - as he is a battle robot now!
