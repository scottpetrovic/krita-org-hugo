Check out all of the Krita merchandise and training material! All proceeds go to support the development of Krita. We are located in the Netherlands, Europe. We sell through [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/krita#) because that's currently the best way to handle VAT in Europe. This unfortunately means that the prices listed here are excluding VAT, since the VAT is different in every country.

**Physical orders**: we use standard postal delivery. Depending on your location this can take between a couple of days and several weeks.
