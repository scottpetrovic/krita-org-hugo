## Suggestions

Do you have ideas to make Krita into an even better program? Great! But before you "report to wishlist", please follow the steps below:

1. Check out [this manual page](https://docs.krita.org/en/untranslatable_pages/new_features.html) on making feature requests!
2. You should then discuss your ideas on the [Forum](https://forum.kde.org/viewforum.php?f=136) or [Krita Artists](https://krita-artists.org/) to get feedback from other Krita users.
3. When your ideas have ripened, it's time to make a feature request (a wish) in [Krita's issue tracker](https://bugs.kde.org).

Please keep in mind that it may take years before a feature is implemented: there are a lot of things that could be done, but only a relatively tiny team of developers. You can help speed this up a bit by working with the developers on additional details such as the graphical interface, as well as providing links to relevant resources. Here is an example of a [good feature proposal write-up](http://www.davidrevoy.com/article159/design-ideas-for-a-new-krita-perspective-tool).
