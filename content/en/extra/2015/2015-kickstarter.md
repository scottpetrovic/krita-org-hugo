**Let's Make Krita Faster than Photoshop!**

We've already made our target goal, so now it's time to work on the stretch goals! Since we've made the target, you can now also back us using Paypal. You can enter any amount and select any corresponding reward level up to the amount you donate. And if you donate 15 euros or more, you will be allowed to vote on the stretch goals, of course!

We reached **3472,58 euros** through paypal!

Thanks everyone who supported our campaign! You will all get a survey by email. If you haven't received your mail by the end of the week, please mail foundation@krita.org!

It's too late to back the campaign now, but you can always [support Krita with donations, through the development fund or by buying dvd's and swag](https://krita.org/support-us/donations/)!
