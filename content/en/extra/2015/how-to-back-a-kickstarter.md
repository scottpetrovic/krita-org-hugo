**Step 1: Back the KickStarter Page**  
Kickstarter only has an English website, so all screenshots will be in English. If you use Google Chrome, you might be able to right click on the pages and click "Translate to xxx". This will make these steps much easier.  
Visit the [KickStarter page](http://www.kickstarter.com) and click the "Back This Project" button
