Contest! Leon and Kiki are exploring their own artistic path. By coincidence, Leon and Kiki met and traveled the art world together. From Spring to Winter, from valley to mountain. It's a path mixed with sweetness and bitterness. And they are enjoying it. Maybe in the end, they will head in different ways. Leon and Kiki will decide to draw down this journey.
