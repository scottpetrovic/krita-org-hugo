如果你收到任何有關 Krita 而非由 krita.org 域名寄出（寄件者不是以 krita.org 結尾）的電子郵件，例如是 krita.io 或 krita.app，請注意這些是**詐騙郵件**。郵件內容如下：

> Hello dear, please give me a moment of your time. Krita team is eager to collaborate with you.
> 
> Krita is a free and open-source raster graphics editor designed primarily for digital painting and 2D animation. It features an OpenGL-accelerated canvas, colour management support, an advanced brush engine, non-destructive layers and masks, group-based layer management, vector artwork support and switchable customisation profiles.
> 
> We would like to consider integrating a 30-45 second ready-made promo into your media space(Facebook, Instagram, YouTube), can we consider that?
> 
> Sincerely, Krita - Digital Painting Studio

**如收到類似的郵件，請勿回覆，只需將其標記為垃圾郵件並舉報為詐騙郵件。**
